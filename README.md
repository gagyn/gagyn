## Hello, I'm Mateusz 👋

I love to write software using **.NET Core** ❤  
  
### Recently  
... I was working on a small project - **[PrawkoChecker-backend](https://github.com/gagyn/PrawkoChecker-backend)** + **[PrawkoChecker-android](https://github.com/gagyn/PrawkoChecker-android)**. There is a Hangfire service which is constanly running on the server and checking every one hour the status of a driving license (e.g. being produced/ready for pickup). The android app allows to easily add your identify number to get updates about your driving license.  
The aim of this project was to check how fast I can develop some simple app (backend + android client).  

### Currently focusing on  
+ **[Watchman](https://devscord-team.github.io/Watchman/)** - open source project in a small team - We're developing a **Discord bot** 🤖 to make Discord servers managment a lot easier! 😀  

### Other small projects  

+ **[TemperatureProject](https://github.com/gagyn/TemperatureProject)** - I love statistics about everything, so why not to save a temperature records outside of my house every one minute and access them through API 😄 (I'm planning also to add some nice charts in future and maybe write an app for android.)  
+ **[Filmweb-API](https://github.com/nickofc/FilmWeb-API)** - I've been helping to develope API client for Filmweb, but some time ago, the unofficial API has been entirely shut down, so the project is closed.
