## Hello, I'm Mateusz 👋

I love to write software using **.NET Core** ❤  
Recently I'm learning a little about Python, while working on [TemperatureProject](https://github.com/gagyn/TemperatureProject)

### Currently focusing on  
+ **[Watchman](https://devscord-team.github.io/Watchman/)** - open source project in a small team - We're developing a **Discord bot** 🤖 to make Discord servers managment a lot easier! 😀  
+ **[TemperatureProject](https://github.com/gagyn/TemperatureProject)** - I love statistics about everything, so why not to save a temperature records outside of my house every one minute and access them through API 😄
